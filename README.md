    cd App-Development_Front-End
    ```

2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Launch Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open" or "Open an Existing Project".

    *   In Android Studio, select "Build" > "Make Project" or click the "Make Project" button (often a hammer icon).

5.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Select a target device (emulator or physical device) from the dropdown menu in the toolbar.
    *   Click the "Run 'app'" button (often a green play icon) or select "Run" > "Run 'app'".
    *   The application will be installed and launched on the selected device/emulator.
